form hide for buttons is not working for next button when gameState === 2
i want the text for players to change according to whose turn it is
if i press any number button to play for a millisecond longer, the gameState is reverted to the earlier one and two circles are formed,
instead of one circle and cross at a time.
I do not understand how to create a diagonal line but am guessing the concept and i cannot test my guess because of the earlier bugs.
Please see if you can help ma'am.
Also i have some problems in database concept please see if you can try and book a project class.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP MA'AM.
